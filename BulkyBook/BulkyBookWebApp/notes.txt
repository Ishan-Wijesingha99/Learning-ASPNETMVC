Dependency Injection...
Let's say we had a website with 3 different pages and we
wanted to access the same database in all 3 pages, we also
wanted to access the same objects in all 3 pages.

It would be cumbersome to recreate those objects and the
database connection for every page, so, we define those 
objects and the database connection in the dependency
injection container (DI container).

This way, we don't have to redefine the objects or database
connection, and we can just change the code in the DI
container and that will change the code everywhere.
